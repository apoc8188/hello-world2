# hello-world2

Hello world. My name is Dan Ng. I currently live in San Francisco and am aiming towards becoming a web developer. I currently drive for Lyft and Uber part time while I am learning to code on my own. I have not decided whether or not I will try to learn coding completely by myself or if I will eventually join a bootcamp as I have only skimmed the surface of coding and do not know if it is something I can learn completely independently or if I should join a bootcamp. The creation of this github account is one of my first steps at coding.
